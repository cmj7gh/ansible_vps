# VPS Configuration with Ansible

Minimal ansible playbook that helps with some of the setup I frequently do on new VPS:
- Install Docker, and setup a new PostgreSQL server via a docker-compose file
- Install Caddy, and host an HTML page
- Setup a firewall

I'll continue adding to this as I learn more - and I welcome any feedback. The next tool that I plan to learn and add is fail2ban
